I used this to get an overview of the dart analyzer class hierarchy. 

Notice how some nodes contain examples for what syntactical construct they correspond to.

One cool part here is that it combines nodes with common parents and children into one node (in orange).

## Notes:

To view PDFs use Finder.

To view Dot files, use Edotor or compile either to PDF or SVG and use one of the above.
